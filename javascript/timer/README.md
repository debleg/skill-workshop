# Timer (Javascript)
What it says on the tin...

Basic functionalities needed:
- [ ] timer creation
- [ ] timer start
- [ ] timer countdown
- [ ] timer pause
- [ ] timer stop (reset)
- [ ] timer end (color change)

Nice to have:
- [ ] reverse timer (count up)
- [ ] play sound on timer end
- [ ] mute sound


Note: I will not be styling this past what is necessary to check it works.
