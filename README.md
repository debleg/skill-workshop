# Skill Workshop
**A place for me to pursue small projects to practice new and current skills.**

For ease of navigation, this repository will be divided into folders dedicated to the relevant language/technology I'm practicing.

Within those, each project will live in its own folder. I'll add a README there if needed, but will most likely document the code directly.
